Today I was trying to install AWS CLI and got this error when running the help command.

~~~sh
raise ValueError, 'unknown locale: %s' % localename
ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
~~~

The solution was to add some environment variables to my zsh environment. So I added this to my `env-config` files.

~~~sh
export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_ALL=
~~~

To test the code run:

~~~sh
python -c 'import locale; print(locale.getdefaultlocale());'
~~~

And you should see `('en_US', 'UTF-8')` as the output.
